                <p>This is the first sentence of Miguel de Cervantes's Don Quixote as a Tracery grammar generated by ChatGPT. I asked it to produce this mirroring, as closely as possible, the style of Pierre Menard, the fictional titular character in Jorge Luis Borges's short story Pierre Menard, Author of the Quixote. Borges's story explores concepts of authorship, authenticity, creativity, and time, in addition to poking fun at certain ways of analyzing literature. Menard attempts, quixotically, to write Cervantes's classic novel, word for word, without copying it and without even trying to recreate Cervantes's mindset. He aims to write the work anew as himself, Pierre Menard, a 20th-century Frenchman, which he considers an even more impressive feat. My version extends Borges's parody by suggesting that some common ways that generative AI is used take Menard's quixotic quest to an even more absurd extreme. If writing the entire Quixote, word for word, as a 20th-century French polymath is more impressive than Cervantes's effort because of the anachronism and Menard's transcendance of his historical context, a rewriting that has no historicity at all and that somehow transcends the full breadth of experience captured in every data set on which ChatGPT was trained is surely even better. Right?
